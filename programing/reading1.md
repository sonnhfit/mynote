a long-haul flight from all the major tourist-generating markets of world.

- **Tourism currently** ``makes`` up 9% of the country's gross domestic product, and ``is`` the country's largest export sector

- Unlike other **export sectors**, which ``make`` products and then ``sell`` them overseas, **tourism** ``brings`` its customers to New Zealand. **The product** ``is`` the country itseft - the people, the places and the experiences.

- in 1999, Tourism **New Zealand** ``launched`` a campaign to ``communicate`` a new brand position to the world. 

- **The campaign** ``focused`` on New Zealand's scenic beauty, **``exhilarating``** outdoor activities and authentic Maori culture, anÄ‘ it made new ``zealand`` one of the strongest national brands in the world 

- **A key feature** of the campaign ``was`` **the website www.newzealand.com**, which ```?provided``` potential visitors to New Zealand with a single gateway to everything the destination ``had?`` to offer.

- **The heart of the website** ``was`` a database of tourism services operators, both those ``based`` in New Zealand and those ``based`` abroad which ``offered`` tourism services to the country.

- **Any tourism-related business could be ``listed`` by filling in a simple form **
- **This meant that ``even`` the smallest bed and breakfast address or specialist activity provider could ``gain`` a web presence with access to an audierice of long-hayk visitors**
- in addition, because participating businesses ``were`` able to ``update`` the details they gave on a regular basis, the information provided ``remained`` accurate.
- And to ``maintain`` and ``improve`` standards, Tourism New Zealand organised a scheme whereby organisations ``appearing`` on the website underwent an independent evaluation against a set of agreed national standards of quality. 
- As part of this, the effect of each business on the environment ``was`` considered

- **To ``communicate`` the New Zealand experience, the site also ``carried`` features relating to famous people and places**

- One of the most popular ``was`` an interview with former New Zealand All Blacks rugby captain Tana Umaga
- Another feature that attracted a lot of attention ``was`` an interactive jouney through a number of the locations chosen for blockbuster films which had made use of New Zealand's stunning scenery as a backrop.
