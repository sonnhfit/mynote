- **New Zealand** ``is`` a small country of four million inhabitants, 
a long-haul flight from all the major tourist-generating markets of world.

- **Tourism currently** ``makes`` up 9% of the country's gross domestic product, and ``is`` the country's largest export sector

- Unlike other **export sectors**, which ``make`` products and then ``sell`` them overseas, **tourism** ``brings`` its customers to New Zealand. **The product** ``is`` the country itseft - the people, the places and the experiences.
